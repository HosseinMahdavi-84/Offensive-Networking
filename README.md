## Why Offensive Networking Matters

| Reason                              | Real-World Use Case                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Everything runs over the network    | Bypass WAFs, firewalls, IDS/IPS                       |
| Hidden assets & misconfigurations   | Subdomain takeover, origin IP leaks, ASN recon        |
| Protocol weaknesses                 | Request smuggling, DNS rebinding, ARP/DHCP spoofing   |
| Lateral movement & persistence      | SSH/DNS/ICMP/SMTP tunneling, port forwarding          |
| Evasion & anti-abuse systems       | IPv6 attacks, fragmentation, chunked encoding tricks  |
